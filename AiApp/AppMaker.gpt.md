## Problem
- Identify needs/requirements: understand the business or user needs that your software is supposed to address.
- Define problem/goal: create a clear and concise definition of the problem that your software is trying to solve or the goal it's trying to achieve.
- Define validations: define how you will validate if a solution solves the problem.

## Solution
- Brainstorm and design solutions: come up with different possible solutions to the problem/goal. design the solutions to ensure they meet the defined validations.
- Prioritize and select solutions: prioritize the possible solutions based on factors like impact, feasibility, and alignment with business goals.
- Implement solutions: write the code to implement the solutions.

## Implementation
- Deploy and monitor: deploy the solution to environment and monitor its performance.
- Validate and verify: ensure that the implemented solution meets the defined validations, and verifies its correctness and effectiveness.
- Feedback and iteration: seek feedback from stakeholders and users, and iterate on the solution based on feedback.

## Maintenance
- Integrate and continuous testing: regularly integrate the code into a shared repository and conduct continuous testing to catch bugs early.
- Retrospect and learn: conduct retrospectives to reflect on what worked and what didn't, and apply the lessons learned in the next iteration.
- Maintenance and refactoring: maintain the solution to ensure it continues to meet its purpose, and continually refactor code to improve readability, reduce complexity, and keep tech debt in check.
